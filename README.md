dotfiles for my rice setup.

Polybar is a modified version of adi1090x's polybar-3 (https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes). The wal.sh in there is a shell script to get wal working with my setup, it might not work for you.

bspwmrc and sxhkdrc should work out of the box. Install picom, devilspie, pywal, etc. to get your transparency.
